# Calculator



This is my very first assignment i.e to make a simple calculator from  python.


I've used tkinter module and made a simple calculator which only does simple calculating like 
multiplication,  division,  subtraction and addition.


I've not learned yet to make it  diplay when we press in keyboard function so we have to use mouse in order to write the number
and make it display  in  the GUI.
